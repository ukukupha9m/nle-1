any existing vampire shape-shifted into critter (fog cloud, bat, wolf) became
	an unkillable critter if vampires were genocided
unlike in previous versions, an uncursed scroll of enchant armor failed to
	uncurse the piece of armor being enchanted (change was unintentional)
slice of {pizza,cake,&} pluralized as "slouse of ..." due to false match
	with "lice" (discovered pre-3.6.0-release)

wrong message given when high priest on astral plane rejects being assigned a

#name or C for discoveries list that spanned multiple pages would exit on
	space instead of advancing to next page (workaround: use '>' instead)

stack splitting for dipping large quantities of potions was done poorly
dipping fruit juice into enlightenment gave different result than the inverse
make travel walk up to a trap and stop when the trap blocks the only
	way forward, instead of trying to go straight line
travel will displace pets rather than stop
do not autopickup unpaid items in shops
death due an unseen gas spore's explosion resulted in "killed by a died"
allow optional parameter "true", "yes", "false", or "no" for boolean options
actually make the castle chest not trapped
level-drain resistance wasn't shown during enlightenment if it was conferred
	by worn/wielded equipment or by lycanthropy
wizard mode enlightenment now shows more reasons for various intrinsics
rehumanizing after being poly'd into vampire left hero with ability to sense
	humans and elves

teleporting or polymorphing a sink via ring drop shouldn't depend upon being

	("capable of being unlocked" vs intended "not capable of being locked")
use doname instead of xname when using '/' or ';' to look at objects on map
when a pet moves reluctantly, name the top item of the pile it is reluctant
	to step on if the hero sees or remembers any object(s) at that spot


Platform- and/or Interface-Specific Fixes
-----------------------------------------
tty: M-N gave "Unknown command 'M-" with "'." finishing the sentence on the

	for confirmation with "Is this ok?" before starting play
unix/X11: in top level Makefile, some commented out definitions of VARDATND
	misspelled pilemark.xbm (as pilemark.xpm)
unix/tty: fix compile warning about 'has_colors' for some configurations
unix: options file with CR+LF line ends and an invalid option line resulted in
	"ad option line: "whatever-the-line-was
	because embedded carriage return character changed cursor's position
win32gui: getversionstring() was overflowing the provided Help About buffer
win32gui: guard against buffer overflow in in mswin_getlin()
