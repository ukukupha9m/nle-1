	the bottom of pit
room cleanup, eg on Bustling Town, could incorrectly truncate room bounds
	for rooms that become L shared due to partial overlap with the MAP

	angered the shopkeeper without ever visibly entering the shop

	longer triggers impossible()
open_levelfile_exclusively() was showing the return value -1 in a panic message,
