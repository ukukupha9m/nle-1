$NHDT-Branch: NetHack-3.6 $:$NHDT-Revision: 1.7 $ $NHDT-Date: 1558234580 2019/05/19 02:56:20 $

This fixes36.3 file is here to capture information about updates in the 3.6.x
lineage following the release of 3.6.2 in May 2019. Please note, however,
that another 3.6.x release is not anticipated, and most developer
focus will shift to the next major release.

General Fixes and Modified Features
-----------------------------------
when place_object() puts a non-boulder on the map at a spot which contains
	other objects, put it under all boulders in the pile rather than just
	under the top one; previously, map wasn't showing a boulder there if
	the top one got moved by means other than pushing
when examining the map with '/' or ';', picking a symbol which is used for
	more than 4 things yielded a sentence lacking its terminating period
billing and payment issue as a result of glob coalescing
glob pricing did not consider weight properly
glob shop interaction improved to handle more of the expected scenarios


Fixes to Post-3.6.2 Problems that Were Exposed Via git Repository
------------------------------------------------------------------


Platform- and/or Interface-Specific Fixes or Features
-----------------------------------------------------
curses: very tall menus tried to use selector characters a-z, A-Z, and 0-9,
	but 0-9 should be reserved for counts and if the display was tall
	enough for more than 62 entries, arbitrary ASCII punctuation got used
curses: when all available lines in the message window are in use,
	autodescribe feedback for 'pick a position with cursor' overwrote
	the last line (usually the 'pick a position' prompt/hint), sometimes
	leaving part of longer underlying line's text visible
curses: if message window is only one line, cancelling some prompts with ESC
	left the prompts visible on the message line instead of erasing them
Windows: some startup error messages were not being delivered successfully


General New Features
--------------------
classify sources as released, beta, or work-in-progress via NH_DEVEL_STATUS
	rather than just released vs beta via BETA


NetHack Community Patches (or Variation) Included
