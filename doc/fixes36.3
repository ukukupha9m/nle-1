$NHDT-Branch: NetHack-3.6 $:$NHDT-Revision: 1.1 $ $NHDT-Date: 1557569075 2019/05/11 10:04:35 $

This fixes36.3 file is here to capture information about updates in the 3.6.x
lineage following the release of 3.6.2 in May 2019. Please note, however,
that another 3.6.x release is not anticipated, and most developer
focus will shift to the next major release.

General Fixes and Modified Features
-----------------------------------
when place_object() puts a non-boulder on the map at a spot which contains
	other objects, put it under all boulders in the pile rather than just
	under the top one; previously, map wasn't showing a boulder there if
	the top one got moved by means other than pushing


Fixes to Post-3.6.2 Problems that Were Exposed Via git Repository
------------------------------------------------------------------


Platform- and/or Interface-Specific Fixes or Features
-----------------------------------------------------
curses: very tall menus tried to use selector characters a-z, A-Z, and 0-9,
	but 0-9 should be reserved for counts and if the display was tall
	enough for more than 62 entries, arbitrary ASCII punctuation got used


General New Features
--------------------
classify sources as released, beta, or work-in-progress via NH_DEVEL_STATUS
	rather than just released vs beta via BETA


NetHack Community Patches (or Variation) Included
-------------------------------------------------


Code Cleanup and Reorganization
-------------------------------
