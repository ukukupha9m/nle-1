$NHDT-Branch: NetHack-3.6 $:$NHDT-Revision: 1.15 $ $NHDT-Date: 1558686805 2019/05/24 08:33:25 $

This fixes36.3 file is here to capture information about updates in the 3.6.x
lineage following the release of 3.6.2 in May 2019. Please note, however,
that another 3.6.x release is not anticipated, and most developer
focus will shift to the next major release.

General Fixes and Modified Features
-----------------------------------
when place_object() puts a non-boulder on the map at a spot which contains
	other objects, put it under all boulders in the pile rather than just
	under the top one; previously, map wasn't showing a boulder there if
	the top one got moved by means other than pushing
when examining the map with '/' or ';', picking a symbol which is used for
	more than 4 things yielded a sentence lacking its terminating period
billing and payment issue as a result of glob coalescing
glob pricing did not consider weight properly
glob shop interaction improved to handle more of the expected scenarios
non-flying steed on Plane of Water would drown when air bubble moved hero
xans fly, but could not reach your feet if you flew


Fixes to Post-3.6.2 Problems that Were Exposed Via git Repository
------------------------------------------------------------------
curses: sometimes the message window would show a blank line after a prompt


Platform- and/or Interface-Specific Fixes or Features
-----------------------------------------------------
curses: very tall menus tried to use selector characters a-z, A-Z, and 0-9,
	but 0-9 should be reserved for counts and if the display was tall
	enough for more than 62 entries, arbitrary ASCII punctuation got used
curses: when all available lines in the message window are in use,
	autodescribe feedback for 'pick a position with cursor' overwrote
	the last line (usually the 'pick a position' prompt/hint), sometimes
	leaving part of longer underlying line's text visible
curses: if message window is only one line, cancelling some prompts with ESC
	left the prompts visible on the message line instead of erasing them
curses: support EDIT_GETLIN (but like with tty, it's disabled by default) to
	pre-load an earlier response as the default answer for some prompts
curses: when display windows get reconfigured (after setting align_status,
	align_message, statuslines, windowborders or due to external resize),
	the message window was being refreshed with the oldest available N
	messages rather than most recent N.  [Still room for improvement;
	when feasible it combines short lines, resulting in N messages on
	fewer than N lines and leaving some of the available lines blank.]
tty: re-do one optimization used when status conditions have all been removed
	and remove another that tried to check whether condition text to be
	displayed next was the same as the existing value; sometimes new
	status condition wouldn't be shown unless a screen redraw was forced
Windows: some startup error messages were not being delivered successfully


General New Features
--------------------
classify sources as released, beta, or work-in-progress via NH_DEVEL_STATUS
	rather than just released vs beta via BETA
