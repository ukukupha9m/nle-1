$NHDT-Branch: NetHack-3.6 $:$NHDT-Revision: 1.90 $ $NHDT-Date: 1562723693 2019/07/10 01:54:53 $

This fixes36.3 file is here to capture information about updates in the 3.6.x
lineage following the release of 3.6.2 in May 2019. Please note, however,
that another 3.6.x release is not anticipated, and most developer
focus will shift to the next major release.

General Fixes and Modified Features
-----------------------------------
when place_object() puts a non-boulder on the map at a spot which contains
	other objects, put it under all boulders in the pile rather than just
	under the top one; previously, map wasn't showing a boulder there if
	the top one got moved by means other than pushing
when examining the map with '/' or ';', picking a symbol which is used for
	more than 4 things yielded a sentence lacking its terminating period
billing and payment issue as a result of glob coalescing
glob pricing did not consider weight properly
glob shop interaction improved to handle more of the expected scenarios
non-flying steed on Plane of Water would drown when air bubble moved hero
xans fly, but could not reach your feet if you flew
adjust vortex database entry to be consistent with fire and energy vortices
when co-located with a boulder you could sometimes swap places with pets of
	any size
on rare occasions, multiple mine's end luckstones were being marked as the
	prize and triggering an impossible() on a public server
make sure the correct luckstone is the prize in mine's end
free dungeon overview's bones information at end of game
free current level's bones information at end of game
free ball and chain if Punished hero dies while descending stairs or dies or
	quits while swallowed; put ball and chain in bones for the stairs case
if hero dies while a thrown or kicked object is in transit, put that object
	on the map in case bones data gets saved
fix a memory leak that occurred if player used wizard mode to leave and return
	to the Plane of Air or Plane of Water (not possible in normal play)
free sortloot data if object handling is short-circuited by cockatrice corpse
on the Plane of Water, make water go all the way to the edges of the level
on the Plane of Air, make clouds disrupt line of sight along the edges
have '&' (whatdoes) command describe movement keystrokes instead of reporting
	them as unknown or showing their number_pad action when that is Off
some improvement to the handling of endgame levels filling up with monsters
if you survive turning into green slime due to life-saving (surviving as a
	green slime) then die again due to green slimes having been genocided,
	the feedback was strange because it assumed that the prior message
	came from answering No to "Really die?" in explore or wizard mode
various cases where objects had their bless/curse state become known weren't
	updating persistent inventory window, when enabled, to reflect changes
	(cited case was trying to remove cursed armor and being told of the
	curse but there were lots of other situations with the same issue)
similar perm_invent issue when lock state known and/or contents known become
	set for carried container
blessed scroll of remove curse read while confused might be shown to operate
	on itself by perm_invent after player is told that it has disappeared
fix memory leak if corpse auto-revival attempt failed ("you feel less hassled")
allow a parent function to issue an an unplacebc() call that restricts
	subsequent placebc() calls to that parent only
flying monsters could enter water on the Plane of Water but then they'd drown
	unless they could also swim or else didn't need to breathe
when finding a place to put a monster on the Plane of Water, don't pick a
	water location for flyers or floaters (levitate) or clingers (ceiling)
#turn worked when unable to speak despite "you chant an arcane formula"
#turn implicitly required sight due to wrong check for avoiding spanning walls
thrown or kicked light source (lit lamp, candle, oil) should emit light as it
	traverses the map; dungeon features, objects, or monsters seen while
	it's in transit will become part of hero's memory of the level, and
	any messages delivered won't have stale light from it around the hero
unlike watching a monster trying to swap out a cursed weapon for some other
	weapon and failing, watching it wield a cursed weapon didn't report
	that weapon becoming welded to the monster's hand/claw/whatever
accept "hidden" as an attribute for wizard mode ^G monster creation; created
	monsters which can't be seen will have their locations highlighted
don't give feedback for monster zapping a wand if a monster plays a fire horn
	directed at self to burn away slime
if hero knows the number of charges in a wand or magical horn and a monster
	acquires it and zaps/plays it when not in view, remove the hero's
	memory of the number of charges
for wizard mode 'monpolycontrol', allow usually disallowed type 'chameleon',
	'doppelganger', or 'sandestin' as answer to "change <monster> @ <x,y>
	into what?" prompt when <monster> is really that type of creature
add Space, Return, and Escape to '? k' (help for menu control keys)
hero can no longer negotiate a bribe with a demon lord when deaf
wishing for "foo amulet" now yields an "amulet of foo" rather than random one
code in parse_conf_file() to trim trailing blanks/cr was skipping over them
partly eaten food with one bite left had message anomalies when eaten; the
	usual "you resume your meal" case lacked the "you're finished" message
	when done; eating something else in between to clobber meal context
	resulted in no messages at all when restarting and finishing last bite
wizard mode ^I menu could list "Not carrying anything" after inventory items
	if perm_invent option was On (even on tty where that's not supported)
wizard mode ^I with 'perm_invent' On would unintentionally filter the content
	of the persistent inventory window to unIDed items if any item got
	chosen to be identified (^R would fix it, as would any invent change)
change #adjust to treat carrying only gold as not having anything to adjust
saving bones with 'perm_invent' On could result in "Bad fruit #N" warnings
update persistent inventory window immediately if 'sortpack' option is toggled
grammar bit for wizard mode final disclosure; attribute section could show
	"You had N experience points, 1 more were needed to attain level X+1."
if an engulfer has any worn items, hero could pick them up from inside and
	they wouldn't be unworn properly, eventually triggering warnings or
	worse (Juiblex will wear an amulet if created with one; a shapechanger
	might wear one and then turn into an engulfer)
kicking an altar ignored god's wrath if hero injured himself during the kick
detect unseen/secret door detection/^E failed to find monsters hiding under
	objects and failed to find monsters hiding at trap locations
when farlook describes a monster at a visible spot as trapped, reveal the trap


Fixes to Post-3.6.2 Problems that Were Exposed Via git Repository
------------------------------------------------------------------
elemental_clog() loop needed to guard against obliteration of the monster
	that was trying to be placed
using ^G to create "hidden mimic" shouldn't have marked it as undetected since
	mimics 'hide' be appearing to be something else; honor "hidden" for
	'hides_under' creatures if/when created at location with object(s),
	also for eels and other fish if/when created at water location
for wizard mode 'wizweight' option, glob weight wasn't shown unless glob had
	shop price information attached
fix for feedback when a monster plays a fire horn at self to cure green slime
	ended up being used for zapping a wand of fire at self too
wizard mode ^I "not carrying anything" still claimed "not carrying anything"
	if "(all items are already identified)" was given
curses: sometimes the message window would show a blank line after a prompt
curses: the change to show map in columns 1..79 instead of 2..80 made the
	highlight for '@' show up in the wrong place if clipped map had been
	panned horizontally
tty: revert the attempt to fix "message line anomaly: if autodecribe feedback
	wrapped to second line, the wrapped portion wasn't erased when a
	shorter line was shown or getpos was dismissed" because it disrupted
	prompts that spanned more than one line, a more significant issue


Platform- and/or Interface-Specific Fixes or Features
-----------------------------------------------------
EDIT_GETLIN: wizard mode 'monpolycontrol' was using the getlin() answer buffer
	to format the coordinate portion of the "change <monster> @ <x,y> into
	what kind of monster?" prompt, resulting in "<x,y>" as default answer
EDIT_GETLIN: when naming an object or a monster use the existing name, if
	there is one, as the default answer
curses: very tall menus tried to use selector characters a-z, A-Z, and 0-9,
	but 0-9 should be reserved for counts and if the display was tall
	enough for more than 62 entries, arbitrary ASCII punctuation got used
curses: when all available lines in the message window are in use,
	autodescribe feedback for 'pick a position with cursor' overwrote
	the last line (usually the 'pick a position' prompt/hint), sometimes
	leaving part of longer underlying line's text visible
curses: if message window is only one line, cancelling some prompts with ESC
	left the prompts visible on the message line instead of erasing them
curses: support EDIT_GETLIN (but like with tty, it's disabled by default) to
	pre-load an earlier response as the default answer for some prompts
	(however, it's skipped if the 'popup_dialog' option is On)
curses: when display windows get reconfigured (after setting align_status,
	align_message, statuslines, windowborders or due to external resize),
	the message window was being refreshed with the oldest available N
	messages rather than most recent N.  [Still room for improvement;
	when feasible it combines short lines, resulting in N messages on
	fewer than N lines and leaving some of the available lines blank.]
curses: plug memory leak when getting a line of input is cancelled by ESC
curses: after requesting a line of input from player, next line of message
	window could end up being skipped
curses: don't convert ^M (or <return> or <enter> key) into ^J; both ^J and ^M
	indicate end of input when typing a line of text but as nethack
	commands, ^J means run toward bottom of screen (when number_pad is
	off) and ^M is not bound to any command, so accidental <return> won't
	cause the hero to try to move
curses: draw map in screen columns 1..79 like tty, rather than in 2..80
curses: make text windows wider so that help feedback is more readable
curses: using ':' for search string matching to toggle menu items in a multple
	page menu would highlight arbitrary items on the currently visible
	page in sync with the lines that matching items had on other pages
curses: when map window was clipped, the 'scrollbars' shown to indicate which
	part of the map was in view didn't work as intended, always drawing
	"*--------------" for horizontal (and comparable '*' with multiple '|'
	underneath for vertical) when it meant to show "---******------" if
	the 2nd and 3rd fifths (for example) were currently within view
curses: support users's setting for erase char and kill char when getting a
	line of input with 'popup_dialog' Off (already supported for popup On)
curses: attempting to use ^H to rush left actually executed ^G (#wizgenesis)
curses: disable the attempt to support Ctrl+Left_click as an alternate way
	to generate Right_click for systems with one-button mouse or trackpad;
	the mouse data passed to nethack didn't match the curses (ncurses on
	OSX 10.11) documentation and things didn't work as intended
curses+'perm_invent': entries were wrapping without any control; usually not
	noticeable because next entry overwrote, but visible for final entry
	when whole inventory fit within the available height; looked ok with
	borders Off but clearly wrong for borders On
curses+'perm_invent': if too many entries for window height, last one which
	fit had the next one appended (including hightlighted selector letter)
	when window borders were Off
curses+'perm_invent': top line was wasted (left blank) when borders Off
curses+'perm_invent': don't highlight inventory letters since nothing is
	selectable from the menu comprising the persistent inventory window
curses+'popup_dialog': show the text cursor at the end of prompts for single
	character input
curses+DUMPLOG: pass along old messages from save file and quest message
	summaries to dumplog message history
curses+EDIT_GETLIN: when a prompt's answer was preloaded, using ESC to discard
	it deleted it from the answer buffer but didn't erase it from screen
curses+EDIT_GETLIN: the preceding fix handled an answer which spanned more
	than one line but didn't remove the answer properly if the prompt
	portion of prompt+answer spanned more than one line
msdos:  code fixes to allow a build with curses and PDCurses
tty: re-do one optimization used when status conditions have all been removed
	and remove another that tried to check whether condition text to be
	displayed next was the same as the existing value; sometimes new
	status condition wouldn't be shown unless a screen redraw was forced
tty: take two, if/when autodecribe feedback wraps past top line, clear
	continuation lines and redraw map if needed when top line is cleared
	['exposed by git' section has an entry for reversal of 'take one']
tty: video attributes (bold, inverse, &c) for status highlighting sometimes
	were scrambled
Windows: some startup error messages were not being delivered successfully


General New Features
--------------------
classify sources as released, beta, or work-in-progress via NH_DEVEL_STATUS
	rather than just released vs beta via BETA
if you reach the edge of a level (relatively uncommon) and try to move off,
	report that you can't go farther if the 'mention_walls' option is set
'attributes' disclosure at end of game includes number of experience points
	that were needed to reach the next experience level (new for normal
	play and explore mode; previously only shown for wizard mode)
report Friday-13th/phase-of-moon/time-of-day for ^X and final disclosure when
	their values matter to game play (date and moon are from the start of
	current session and are not dynamically updated as real time elapses;
	night is a fixed range of hours using the computer's conception of
	local time which could differ from player's if there are time zone or
	system clock issues or simply seasonal variation based on latitude;
	not new but needs to be documented somewhere other than spoilers...)
status highlighting using percentage rules now supported for experience level
	and experience points; for both, percent is based on Exp progress from
	the start of the current Xp level to the start of the next Xp level;
	100% isn't possible so used as special case for next_Xp_lvl - 1 Exp_pt
wizard-mode: display effect to show where an unseen wished-for monster landed
curses: enable latent mouse support
curses: give menus and text windows a minimum size of 5x25 since tiny ones can
	sometimes be overlooked when shown over old messages rather than map
curses+'perm_invent': since persistent inventory is narrow, strip off "a",
	"an", or "the" prefix on inventory entries shown there so that a tiny
	bit more of the interesting portion is visible
