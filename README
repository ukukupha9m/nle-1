                NetHack 3.5.0 -- General information

NetHack 3.5 is an enhancement to the dungeon exploration game NetHack.
It is a distant descendent of Rogue and Hack, and a direct descendent of
NetHack 3.4.

NetHack 3.5.0 has many new features.
 *  List new features here

A fuller list of changes for this release can be found in the file 
doc/fixes35.0 in the source distribution.  The text in there was written 
for the development team's own use and is provided "as is", so please do 
not ask us to further explain the entries in that file.

                        - - - - - - - - - - -

Please read items (1), (2) and (3) BEFORE doing anything with your new code.

1.  Unpack the code in a dedicated new directory.  We will refer to that
    directory as the 'Top' directory.  It makes no difference what you
    call it.

2.  If there is no flaw in the packaging, many sub-directories will be
    automatically created, and files will be deposited in them:

    a.  A 'dat' directory, which contains a variety of data files.
    b.  A 'doc' directory, which contains various documentation.
    c.  An 'include' directory, which contains *.h files.
    d.  A 'src' directory, which contains game *.c files used by all versions.
    e.  A 'util' directory, which contains files for utility programs.
    f.  A 'sys' directory, which contains subdirectories for files that
        are operating-system specific.
    g.  A 'sys/share' subdirectory, which contains files shared by some OSs.
    h.  A 'sys/share/sounds' subsubdirectory, which contains sound files
        shared by some OSs.
    i.  A 'sys/amiga' subdirectory, which contains files specific to AmigaDOS.
    j.  A 'sys/atari' subdirectory, which contains files specific to TOS.
    k.  A 'sys/be' subdirectory, which contains files specific to Be OS.
    l.  A 'sys/mac' subdirectory, which contains files specific to MacOS.
    m.  A 'sys/msdos' subdirectory, which contains files specific to MS-DOS.
    n.  A 'sys/os2' subdirectory, which contains files specific to OS/2.
    o.  A 'sys/unix' subdirectory, which contains files specific to UNIX.
    p.  A 'sys/vms' subdirectory, which contains files specific to VMS.
    q.  A 'sys/wince' subdirectory, which contains files specific to Windows CE.
    r.  A 'sys/wince/ceinc' subdirectory; header files for Windows CE
    s.  A 'sys/wince/ceinc/sys' subdirectory; ditto
    t.  A 'sys/winnt' subdirectory, which contains files specific to Windows NT.
    u.  A 'win' directory, which contains subdirectories for files that
        are windowing-system specific (but not operating-system specific).
    v.  A 'win/share' subdirectory, which contains files shared by some
        windowing systems.
    w.  A 'win/Qt' subdirectory, which contains files specific to Qt.
    x.  A 'win/X11' subdirectory, which contains files specific to X11.
    y.  A 'win/gem' subdirectory, which contains files specific to GEM.
    z.  A 'win/gnome' subdirectory, which contains files specific to GNOME.
    A.  A 'win/tty' subdirectory, which contains files specific to ttys.
    B.  A 'win/win32' subdirectory, which contains files specific to the
        Windows Win32 API.

    The names of these directories should not be changed unless you are
    ready to go through the makefiles and the makedefs program and change
    all the directory references in them.

3.  Having unpacked, you should have a file called 'Files' in your Top
    directory.  This file contains the list of all the files you now SHOULD
    have in each directory.  Please check the files in each directory
    against this list to make sure that you have a complete set.

4.  Before you do anything else, please read carefully the file called
    "license" in the 'dat' subdirectory.  It is expected that you comply
    with the terms of that license, and we are very serious about it.

5.  If everything is in order, you can now turn to trying to get the program
    to compile and run on your particular system.  It is worth mentioning
    that the default configuration is SysV/Sun/Solaris2.x (simply because
    the code was housed on such a system).  It is also worth mentioning
    here that NetHack 3.5 is a huge program.  If you intend to run it on a
    small machine, you'll have to make hard choices among the options
    available in config.h.

    The files sys/*/Install.* were written to guide you in configuring the
    program for your operating system.  The files win/*/Install.* are
    available, where necessary, to help you in configuring the program
    for particular windowing environments.  Reading them, and the man pages,
    should answer most of your questions.

    At the time of this release, NetHack 3.5 is known to run/compile on:

        Intel 80386 or greater (or clone) boxes running Linux, BSDI, or
                Windows NT/XP/2000/2003/2008
        Intel Pentium or better (or clone) running BeOS 4.5
        Sun SPARC based machine running SunOS 4.x, Solaris 2.x, or Solaris 7


    Previous versions of NetHack were tested on the following systems,
    and with a little work we expect that NetHack 3.5 will work on them 
    as well:

        Apple Macintosh running MacOS 7.5 or higher, LinuxPPC, BeOS 4.0
        Atari ST/TT/Falcon running TOS (or MultiTOS) with GCC
        AT&T 3B1 running System V (3.51)
        AT&T 3B2/600 & 3B2/622 running System V R3.2.1
        AT&T 3B2/1000 Model 80 running System V R3.2.2

        Data General AViiON systems running DG/UX
        DEC Alpha/VMS (aka OpenVMS AXP), running V1.x through V7.1
        DEC VAX/VMS, running V4.6 through V7.1

        IBM PS/2 and AT compatibles running OS/2 - 2.0 and up with GCC emx
        IBM PS/2 and AT compatibles running OS/2 1.1 - 2.0 (and probably
           Warp) with Microsoft 6.0, and OS/2 2.0 and up with IBM CSet++ 2.0.
        Intel 80386 or greater (or clone) running 386BSD

        Sun-3s and -386is running SunOS 4.x
        Valid Logic Systems SCALD-System

    Unless otherwise mentioned, the compiler used was the OS-vendor's
    C compiler.

    NetHack 3.5 may also run on the following, but a cross-compiler hosted
    on another platform, such as win32, would be required to build from 
    source.

        Pocket PC devices running Windows CE 3.0 and higher
        H/PC Pro devices running Windows CE 2.11 and higher.
	Palm Size PC 1.1 devices running Windows CE 2.11

    The sources necessary to build an 80286 DOS "real mode" overlaid version 
    are still included in the source distribution, so if someone has access 
    to a real-mode compiler and lots of spare time on their hands, you may 
    be able to get things working. Of course you do so at your own risk.

                        - - - - - - - - - - -

If you have problems building the game, or you find bugs in it, we recommend 
filing a bug report from our "Contact Us" web page at:
    http://www.nethack.org/ 

When sending correspondence, please observe the following:
o Please be sure to include your machine type, OS, and patchlevel.
o Never send us binary files (e.g. save files or bones files). Whichever 
  platform you are using, only a small minority of the development team has 
  access to it, and you will rapidly annoy the others.  If you have found 
  a bug and think that your save file would aid in solving the problem, 
  send us a description in words of the problem, your machine type, your 
  operating system, and the version of NetHack.  Tell us that you have a 
  save file, but do not actually send it.
  In the rare case that we think your save file would be helpful, you will
  be contacted by a member of the development team with the address of a
  specific person to send the save file to.
o Though we make an effort to reply to each bug report, it may take some
  time before you receive feedback.  This is especially true during the
  period immediately after a new release, when we get the most bug reports.
o We don't give hints for playing the game.
o Don't bother to ask when the next version will be out.  You will not get
  a reply.

If you don't have access to the world wide web, or if you want to submit
a patch for the NetHack source code via email directly, you can direct it 
to this address:
    nethack-bugs (at) nethack.org

If a feature is not accepted you are free, of course, to post the patches 
to the net yourself and let the marketplace decide their worth.

All of this amounts to the following:  If you decide to apply a free-lanced
patch to your 3.5 code, you are on your own.  In our own patches, we will
assume that your code is synchronized with ours.

                  -- Good luck, and happy Hacking --
