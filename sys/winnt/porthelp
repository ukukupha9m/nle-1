                   (Last Revision: March 10, 2002)

This file details specifics for NetHack built for Windows 95, 98, NT, 
Me, 2000, and XP. Users of really early 16-bit Windows versions should 
use the MSDOS NetHack. 

Please note that "NetHack for Windows - Graphical Interface" requires 
an installation of Internet Explorer 4 or an installation of 
version 4.71 of the common controls. See the following internet page: 
    http://www.nethack.org/v340/ports/download-win.html#cc
for more information. If the game runs for you, you are not affected.

New players should be sure to read GuideBook.txt which contains 
essential information about playing NetHack. It can be found in the
same directory as your NetHack executable.

The Windows port of NetHack supports some additional or enhanced 
commands as well as some defaults.nh file options specific to 
configuration choices used during the building of NetHack for 
Windows. Listed below are those commands and defaults.nh file 
options. 

Some options are applicable only to the graphical port. 
These are discussed separately in their own section.

2. Boolean Options
------------------

Listed here are any options not discussed in the main help, options 
which may be slightly different from the main help file, and options 
which may need a slightly more explanatory note: 

    color          Use color when displaying non-tiled maps. Tiled 
                   maps (available in the graphical port) are always 
                   rendered in color. Default: [TRUE]

    IBMgraphics    Use IBM extended characters for the dungeon 
                   Default: [TRUE] 
 
    use_inverse    Use inverse color for detection (similar to hilite_pet). 
                   Default: [FALSE] 

    msg_window     When ^P is pressed, it shows menu in a full window.
                   Available only in the non-graphical (tty) version.
                   Default: [FALSE] 


3. Graphical Port Complex Options
---------------------------------

"NetHack for Windows - Graphical Interface" recognizes the following 
additional options, which the non-graphical (tty) version will
silently ignore.  These are options that specify attributes of various
windows.  These include the menu windows (such as the inventory list),
the text windows (such as "It is written in the book of ..."
screens), the message window (where events of the game are
displayed), the status window (where your character name
and attributes are displayed), and the map window (where the dungeon
is drawn).

Window Alignment options:

    align_message  Specifies at which side of the NetHack screen the 
                   message window is aligned. This option can be used 
                   to align the window to "top" or "bottom". "left" 
                   or "right" are possible, but not properly supported 
                   in the Microsoft Windows port. Default: [TOP] 

    align_status   Specifies at which side of the NetHack screen the 
                   status window is aligned. This option can be used 
                   to align the window to "top" or "bottom". "left" 
                   or "right" are possible, but not properly supported 
                   in the Microsoft Windows port. Default: [BOTTOM] 

Map Window options:

    map_mode       Specifies which map mode to use. 
                   The following map modes are available: 
                   tiles (uses tiles to display things on the map), 
                   ascii4x6ascii6x8, ascii8x8, ascii16x8, ascii7x12
                   ascii8x12, ascii16x12, ascii12x16, ascii10x18
                   (which use that size font to display things on 
                   the map), or fit_to_screen (which forces things
                   to fit on a single screen). Default: [tiles]

    scroll_margin  Specifies the margin of scrolling the map. 
                   Recommended to be set to 1 or greater. If set to 
                   80, this will keep your character centered on the map. 
                   Default: [5] 

    tile_file      An alternative file containing bitmap to use for 
                   tiles. This file should be a .bmp file and should 
                   be organized as 40 rectangular tiles wide. It is 
                   beyond the scope of this document to describe the 
                   exact contents of each tile in the .bmp which may 
                   even be dependent on the options with which your
                   version of NetHack was built.

                   If you are interested in creating a tile file of 
                   your own, create a regular build of NetHack using 
                   the graphical version and examine the file tiles.bmp 
                   in the src or build directory. This option may 
                   only be specified in the defaults.nh config file. 
                   Default: [default] 

    tile_height    Used with tile_file to specify the height of each 
                   tile in pixels. This option may only be specified
                   in the defaults.nh config file. 
                   Default: [16] 

    tile_width     Used with tile_file to specify the width of each 
                   tile in pixels. This option may only be specified
                   in the defaults.nh config file. 
                   Default: [16]

    windowcolors   Specifies the colors for various windows
                   This option may only be specified in the
                   defaults.nh config file and has the following
                   format:
                       window-type foreground/background
                   Notes:
                      - Both foreground and background colors are
                        required, and a slash must separate them.
                      - "window-type" is either "message" or "status"
                        (Short forms are: "msg" or "sts").
                      - "foreground" and "background" may be specified as
                        a color name (such as "blue"), or by a six
                        digit hexadecimal RGB color value (such as
                        "#8F8F8F")
                      - The following color names are available:
                        black, red, green, brown, blue, magenta,
                        cyan, gray (or grey), orange, brightgreen,
                        yellow, brightblue, brightmagenta, brightcyan,
                        white, trueblack, purple, silver, maroon, fuchsia,
                        lime, olive, navy, teal, aqua. In addition, you 
                        can use the following names to refer to default 
                        Windows settings: activeborder, activecaption, 
                        appworkspace, background, btnface, btnshadow, btntext, 
                        captiontext, graytext, highlight, highlighttext, 
                        inactiveborder, inactivecaption, menu, menutext,

4. Graphical Port Additional/Enhanced Commands
----------------------------------------------

The following function keys are active in
the "NetHack for Windows - Graphical Interface": 

    F4             Toggle level overview mode on/off 
                   This key will toggle the map between a view that 
                   is mapped to fit exactly to the window, and the 
                   view that shows the various symbols in their 
                   normal size. This is useful for getting an idea 
                   of where you are in a level. 

    F5             Toggle tiled display on/off. 
                   This key switches between the tiled and the 
                   traditional ASCII display. This is equivalent to 
                   using the "map_mode" option. 

    F10            Activate menu bar. 
                   This key will activate the menu bar, allowing you 
                   to select between the menus: File, Map, 
                   Window Settings, and Help. 

5. Graphical Port Menus
-----------------------

File
  Save - Allows you to save and exit the game
  Quit - Allows you to quit the game

Map - Provides for selection of map mode. Equivalent to using 
the map_mode option. 

Window Settings - Changes your logged-on user's settings for 
NetHack. In 3.4.0, only one setting is available: NetHack 
mode, which can be checked or unchecked. NetHack mode allows 
you to use ALT-f, ALT-m, and ALT-s for game key commands 
[see list above]. You can use F10 to access the menu bar while 
in NetHack mode. You can also clear your logged-on user's 
settings for NetHack. Settings in this window are saved in 
your logged-on user's registry. 

Help - Provides help about various portions of NetHack.
