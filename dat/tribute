%title The Colour of Magic  (2)
%passage 1
The Colour of Magic, by Terry Pratchett

It has been remarked before that those who are sensitive to radiation in the
far octarine - the eighth colour, the pigment of the Imagination - can see
things that others cannot.

Thus it was that Rincewind, hurrying through the crowded, flare-lit, evening
bazarrs of Morpork with the Luggage trundling behind him, jostled a tall
figure, turned to deliver a few suitable curses, and beheld Death.

It had to be Death.  No-one else went around with empty eye sockets and, of
course, the scythe over one shoulder was another clue.
%e passage 1
%passage 2
As he was drawn towards the Eye the terror-struck Rincewind raised the box
protectively, and at the same time heard the picture imp say, 'They're about
ripe now, can't hold them any longer.  Every-one smile, please.'

There was a -
- flash of light so white and so bright - 
- it didn't seem like light at all.

Bel-Shamharoth screamed, a sound that started in the far ultrasonic and
finished somewhere in Rincewind's bowels.  The tentacles went momentarily as
stiff as rods, hurling their various cargos around the room, before bunching
up protectively in front of the abused Eye.  The whole mass dropped into the
pit and a moment later the big slab was snatched up by several dozen tentacles
and slammed into place, leaving a number of thrashing limbs trapped around the
edge.

Ankh-Morpork had dallied with many forms of government and hand ended up with that form of democracy known as One Man, One Vote. The Patrician was the Man; he had the Vote.

%passage 1
  'Maybe you could... help us?'
  'What's wrong?'
  'It's my boy...'
  Granny opened the door further and saw the womand standing behind Mr. Slot. One look at her face was enough. There was a bundle in her arms.
  Granny stepped back. 'Bring him in and let me have a look at him.'
  She took the baby from the woman, sat down on the room's one chair, and pulled back the blanket.
  'Hmm,' said Granny, after a while.
  'There's a curse on this house, that's what it is,' said Slot. 'My best cow's been taken mortally sick, too.'
  'Oh? You have a cowshed?' siad Granny. 'Very good place for a sick-room, a cowshed. It's the warmth. You better show me were it is.'
  'You want to take the boy down there?'
  'Right now.'
  [...]
  'How many have you come for?'
  ONE.
  'The cow?'
  Death shook his head.
  'It could be the cow.'
  NO. THAT WOULD BE CHANGING HISTORY.
  'History is about things changing.'
  NO.
  Granny sat back.
  'Then I challenge you to a game. That's traditional. That's /allowed/.'
  Death was silent for a moment.
  THIS IS TRUE.
  'Good.'
  HOWEVER... YOU UNDERSTAND THAT TO WIN ALL YOU MUST GAMBLE ALL?
  'Double or quits? Yes, I know.'
  BUT NOT CHESS.
  'Can't abide chess.'
  OR CRIPPLE MR ONION. I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE RULES.
  'Very well. How about one hand of poker? Five cards each, no draws? Sudden death, as they say.'
  Death thought about this, too.
  YOU KNOW THIS FAMILY?
  'No.'
  THEN WHY?
  'Are we talking or are we playing?'
  OH, VERY WELL.
  Granny looked at her cards, and threw them down.
  FOUR QUEENS. HMM. THAT /IS/ VERY HIGH.
  Death looked down at his cards, and then up into Granny's steady, blue-eyed gaze.
  Neither moved for some time.
  Then Death laid the hand on the table.
  I LOSE. ALL I HAVE IS FOUR ONES.

    Yrs sincerely,
    The Opera Ghost
  'What sort of person,' said Salzella, 'sits down and /writes/ a maniacal laugh? And all those exclamation marks, you notice? Five? A sure sign of someone who wears his underpants on his head. Opera can do that to a man.'

%passage 3
  Agnes had woken up one morning with the horrible realization that she'd been saddled with a lovely personality. It was the lack of choice that rankled. No one had asked her, before she was born, whether she wanted a lovely personality or whether she'd prefer, say, a miserable personality but a body that could take size 9 in dresses. Instead, people would take pains to tell her that beauty was only skin-deep, as if a man ever fell for an attractive pair of kidneys.

  'And what can I get you, officers?' she said.
  'Officers? Us? What makes you think we're watchment?'
  'He's got a helmet on,' Nanny pointed out.
  'Milit'ry chic,' Nobby said. 'It's just a fashion accessory. Actually, we are gentlemen of means and have nothing to do with the City Watch whatsoever.'
  'Well, /gentlemen/, would you like some wine?'
  'Not while we on duty, t'anks', said the troll.

The Truth, by Terry Pratchett

There are, it has been said, two types of people in the world. There are those
who, when presented with a glass that is exactly half full, say: this glass is
half full. And then there are those who say: this glass is half empty.

The world belongs, however, to those who can look at the glass and say: What's
up with this glass?  Excuse me?  Excuse me?  This is may glass?  I don't think
so. My glass was full! And it was a bigger glass!  Who's been pinching my beer?
