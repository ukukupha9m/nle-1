%title The Colour of Magic  (2)
%passage 1
It has been remarked before that those who are sensitive to radiation in
the far octarine - the eighth colour, the pigment of the Imagination - can
see things that others cannot.

Thus it was that Rincewind, hurrying through the crowded, flare-lit,
evening bazarrs of Morpork with the Luggage trundling behind him, jostled a
tall figure, turned to deliver a few suitable curses, and beheld Death.

It had to be Death.  No-one else went around with empty eye sockets and, of
course, the scythe over one shoulder was another clue.

%passage 2
As he was drawn towards the Eye the terror-struck Rincewind raised the box
protectively, and at the same time heard the picture imp say, 'They're
about ripe now, can't hold them any longer.  Every-one smile, please.'

There was a -
- flash of light so white and so bright - 
- it didn't seem like light at all.

Bel-Shamharoth screamed, a sound that started in the far ultrasonic and
finished somewhere in Rincewind's bowels.  The tentacles went momentarily
as stiff as rods, hurling their various cargos around the room, before
bunching up protectively in front of the abused Eye.  The whole mass
dropped into the pit and a moment later the big slab was snatched up by
several dozen tentacles and slammed into place, leaving a number of
thrashing limbs trapped around the edge.

%passage 1
'Cohen is my name, boy' Belthan's hands stopped moving.
'Cohen?' she said, 'Cohen the Barbarian?'
'The very shame.'
'Hang on, hang on,' said Rincewind, 'Cohen's a great big chap, neck like a
bull, got chest muscles like a sack of footballs.  I mean, he's the Disc's
greatest warrior, a legend in his own lifetime.  I remember my grandad
telling me he saw him ... my grandad telling me he ... my grandad ...'
He faltered under the gimlit gaze.
'Oh,' he said, 'Oh. Of course, Sorry.'
'Yesh,' said Cohen, and sighed, 'Thatsh right boy, I'm a lifetime in my own
legend.'

%passage 2
Death sat at one side of a black baize table in the entre of the room,
arguing with Famine, War and Pestilence.  Twoflower was the only one to
look up and notice Rincewind.
'Hey, how did you get here?' he said.
'Well, some say that the creator took a handful - oh, I see, well, it's
hard to explain but I -'
'Have you got the Luggage?'
The wooden box pushed past Rincewind and settled down in front of its
owner, who opened its lid and rummaged around inside until he came up with
a small, leatherbound book which he handed to War, who was hammering the
table with a mailed fist.
'It's "Nosehinger on the Laws of Contract",' he said. 'It's quite good,
there's a lot in it about double finessing and how to -'
Death snatched the book with a bony hand and flipped through the pages, 
quite oblivious to the presence of the two men.
'RIGHT,' he said, 'PESTILENCE, OPEN ANOTHER PACK OF CARDS. I'M GOING TO GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS IF IT KILLS ME. FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING OF COURSE.'

%passage 3
Animal minds are simple, and therefore sharp. Animals never spend time
dividing experience into little bits and speculating about all the bits 
they've missed. The whole panoply of the universe has been neatly 
expressed to them as things to (a) mate with, (b) eat, (c) run away from, 
and (d) rocks. This frees the mind from unnecessary thoughts and gives 
it a cutting edge where it matters. Your normal animal, in fact, never
tries to walk and chew gum at the same time. 

The average human, on the other hand, thinks about all sorts of things 
around the clock, on all sorts of levels, with interruptions from dozens
of biological calendars and timepieces. There's thoughts about to be said,
and private thoughts, and real thoughts, and thoughts about thoughts, and 
a whole gamut of subconscious thoughts. To a telepath the human head is 
a din. It is a railway terminus with all the Tannoys talking at once. 
It is a complete FM waveband- and some of those stations aren't reputable,
they're outlawed pirates on forbidden seas who play late-night records with
limbic lyrics.

%passage 2
#submitted by Boudewijn
Verence tried to avoid walking through walls. A man had his dignity.
He became aware that he was being watched.
He turned his head.
There was a cat sitting in the doorway, subjecting him to a slow blink.
It was a mottled grey and extremely fat...
No. It was extremely /big/. It was covered with so much scar tissue 
that it looked like a fist with fur on it. Its ears were a couple of
perforated stubs, its eyes two yellow slits of easy-going malevolence,
its tail a twitching series of question marks as it stared at him.
Greebo had heard that Lady Felmet had a small white female cat and had
strolled up to pay his respects. Verence had never seen an animal with
so much built-in villainy. He didn't resist as it waddled across the
floor and dried to rub itself against his legs, purring like a 
waterfall.

'Well, well,' said the king, vaguely. He reached down and made an 
effort to scratch it behind the two ragged bits on top of its head. 
It was a relief to find someone else besides another ghost who could 
see him, and Greebo, he couldn't help feeling, was a distinctly unusual
cat. Most of the castle cats were either pampered pets or flat-eared 
kitchen and stable habitues who generally resembled the very rodents
they lived on. This cat, on the other hand, was its own animal. All 
cats give that impression, of course, but instead of the mindless 
animal self-absorption that passes for secret wisdom in the creatures, 
Greebo radiated genuime intelligence. He also radiated a smell that 
would have knocked over a wall and caused sinus trouble in a dead fox.

%passage 1
No enemies had ever taken Ankh-Morpork. Well, /technically/ they had, quite
 often; the city welcomed free-spending barbarian invaders, but somehow the
 puzzled raiders always found, after a few days, that they didn't own their
 own horses any more, and within a couple of months they were just another
minority group with its own graffiti and food shops.

Rincewind looked down at the broad steps they were climbing. They were
 something of a novelty; each one was built out of large stone letters. The
 one he was just stepping on to, for example, read: I Meant It For The Best.
The next one was: I Thought You'd Like It.
Eric was standing on: For The Sake Of The Children.
'Weird, isn't it?' he said. 'Why do it like this?'
'I think they're meant to be good intentions,' said Rincewind. This was a
road to hell, and demons were, after all, traditionalists.

There was a dog sitting by his feet.
It was small, bow-legged and wiry, and basically grey but with patches of

said 'Woof?'   Victor poked an exploratory finger in his ear. It must have
 been a trick of an echo, or something. It wasn't that the dog had gone
 'woof!', although that was practically unique in itself; most dogs in the
 universe /never/ went 'woof!', they had complicated barks like 'whuuugh!'
 and 'hwhoouf!'. No, it was that it hadn't in fact /barked/ at all. It had
/said/ 'woof'.   'Could have bin worse, mister. I could have said "miaow".'

Elves are glamorous. They project glamour.
Elves are enchanting. They weave enchantment.
Elves are terrific. They beget terror.

It was very hard, being a reader in Invisible Writings.(1)

(1) The study of invisible writings was a new discipline made available by
the discovery of the bi-directional nature of Library-Space.  The thaumic
mathematics are complex, but boil down to the fact that all books,
everywhere, affect all other books.  This is obvious:  books inspire
other books written in the future, and cite books written in the past.
But the General Theory(2) of L-Space suggests that, in that case, the
contents of books /as yet unwritten/ can be deduced from books now in
existence.

(2) There's a Special Theory as well, but no one bothers with it much
because it's self-evidently a load of marsh gas.

The dwarf's expression did not change.

Ridcully looked the elegantly dressed stranger up and down, or rather

What is magic?

There is the wizards' explanation, which comes in two forms, depending on
the age of the wizard.  Older wizards talk about candles, circles, planets,
stars, bananas, chants, runes, and the importance of having at least four
good meals every day.  Younger wizards, particularly the pale ones who
spend most of their time in the High Energy Magic building,(1) chatter at
length about fluxes in the morphic nature of the universe, the essentially
impermanent quality of even the most apparently rigid time-space framework,
the impossibility of reality, and so on:  what this means is that they have
got hold of something hot and are gabbling the physics as they go along.

(1) It was here that the thaum, hitherto believed to be the smallest
possible particle of magic, was successfully demonstrated to made up of
/resons/(2) or reality fragments.  Currently research indicates that each
reson is itself made up of a combination of at least five "flavors,"
known as "up," "down," "sideways," "sex appeal," and "peppermint."

What is magic?

Then there is the witches' explanation, which comes in two forms, depending
on the age of the witch.  Older witches hardly put words to it at all, but
may suspect in their hearts that the universe really doesn't know what the
hell is going on and consists of a zillion trillion billion possibilities,
and could become any of them if a trained mind rigid with quantum certainty
was inserted in the crack and /twisted/; that, if you really had to make
someone's hat explode, all you needed to do was /twist/ into the universe
where a large number of hat molecules all decide at the same time to bounce
off in different directions.

Younger witches, on the other hand, talk about it all the time and believe
it involves crystals, mystic forces, and dancing about without yer drawers
on.

Everyone may to right, all at the same time.  That's the thing about
quantum.

A voice from within said, "That's him!  He stole my horse!"

A wizard's staff poked out.  The chieftain saw the knob on the end.

"Now then," he said pleasantly.  "I know the rules.  Wizards aren't allowed
to use magic against civilians except in genuine life-threatening situa--"

There was a burst of octarine light.

"Actually, it's not a rule," said Ridcully.  "It's more a guideline."  He
turned to Ponder Stibbons.  "Interestin' use of Stacklady's Morphic
Resonator here, I hoped you noticed."

It couldn't have been done from life.  In the days of /this/ queen, the

But a few generations ago King Lully I had been a bit of a historian and a
romantic.  He'd researched what was known of the early days of Lancre, and
where actual evidence had been a bit sparse he had, in the best traditions
of the keen ethnic historian, inferred from revealed self-evident wisdom(1)
and extrapolated from associated sources(2).  He'd commissioned the

#addition text contributed by Boudewijn
Everything starts somewhere, though many physicists disagree. 
But people have always been dimly aware of the problem with the start of
things.  They wonder how the snowplough driver gets to work, or how the
makers of dictionaries look up the spelling of words.  Yet there is the
constant desire to find some point in the twisting, knotting, ravelling
nets of space-time on which a metaphorical finger can be put to indicate
that here, /here/, is the point where it all began . . .

/Something/ began when the Guild of Assassins enrolled Mister Teatime,
who saw things differently from other people, and one of the ways that 
he saw things differently from other people was in seeing other people
as things (later, Lord Downey of the Guild said, 'We took pity on him 
because he'd lost both parents at an early age. I think that, on 
reflection, we should have wondered a bit more about that.')

If it was us, what did that make Me?  After all, I'm one of Us. I must be.
I've certainly never thought of myself as one of Them.  No one ever thinks
of themselves as one of Them. We're always one of Us.  It's Them that do
the bad things.

There was a general shifting of position and a group clearing of throats.
'What about mercenaries?' said Boggis.
'The problem with mercenaries', said the Patrician, 'is that they need
to be paid to start fighting. And, unless you are very lucky, you end
up paying them even more to stop--'
Selachii thumped the table.
'Very well, then, by jingo!' he snarled. 'Alone!'
'We could certainly do with one,' said Lord Vetinari. 'We need the 
money. I was about to say that we cannot /afford/  mercenaries.'
'How can this be?' said Lord Downey. Don't we pay our taxes?'
'Ah, I thought we might come to that,' said Lord Vetinari. He raised
his hand and, on cue again, his clerk placed a piece of paper in it.
'Let me see now . . . ah yes. Guild of Assassins . . . Gross earnings
in the last year: AM$13,207,048. Taxes paid in the last year: 
forty-seven dollars, twenty-two pence and what on examination turned
out to be a Hershebian half-/dong/, worth one eighth of a penny.'
'That's all perfectly legal! The Guild of Accountants--'
'Ah yes. Guild of Accountants: gross earnings AM$7,999,011. 
Taxes paid: nil. But, ah yes, I see they applied for a rebate of 
AM$200,000.'
'And what we received, I may say, included a Hershebian half-/dong/,'
said Mr Frostrip of the Guild of Accountants.
'What goes around comes around,' said Vetinari calmly.
He tossed the paper aside. 'Taxation, gentlemen, is very much like
dairy farming. The task is to extract the maximum amount of milk with
the minimum of moo. And I am afraid to say that these days all I get is 
moo.' 
'Are you telling us that Ankh-Morpork is /bankrupt/?' said Downey.
'Of course. While, at the same time, full of rich people. I trust they
have been spending their good fortume on swords.'
'And you have /allowed/ this wholesale tax avoidance?' said Lord 
Selachii. 'Oh, the taxes haven't been avoided,' said Lord Vetinari.
'Or even evaded. They just haven't been paid.'
'That is a disgusting state of affairs!'
The Patrician raised his eyebrows. 'Commander Vines?'
'Yes, sir?'
'Would you be so good as to assemble a squad of your most experienced
men, liaise with the tax gatherers and obtain the accumulated back 
taxes, please? My clerk here will give you a list of the prime 
defaulters.'
'Right, sir. And if they resist, sir?' said Vimes, smiling nastily.
'Oh, how can they resist, commander? This is the will of our civic 
leaders.' He took the paper his clerk proferred. 'Let me see, now. 
Top of the list--' Lord Selachii coughed hurriedly. 'Far too late for
that sort of nonsense now,' he said.
'Water under the bridge,' said Lord Downey.
'Deat and buried,' said Mr Slant.
'I paid mine,' said Vimes.

He'd noticed that sex bore some resemblance to cookery:  It facinated
people, they sometimes bought books full of complicated recipes and
interesting pictures, and sometimes when they were really hungry they
created vast banquets in their imagination - but at the end of the day
they'd settle quite happily for egg and chips, if it was well done and
maybe had a slice of tomato.

There are, it has been said, two types of people in the world. There are
those who, when presented with a glass that is exactly half full, say: this
glass is half full. And then there are those who say: this glass is half
empty. 

The world belongs, however, to those who can look at the glass and say:
What's up with this glass?  Excuse me?  Excuse me?  This is my glass?  I
don't think so. My glass was full! And it was a bigger glass!  Who's been

Too many people, when listing all the perils to be found in the search
for lost treasure or ancient wisdom, had forgotten to put at the top of
the list 'the man who arrived just before you'.

%passage 2
The reason for the story was a mix of many things.  There was humanity's
desire to do forebidden deeds merely because they were forbidden.
There was its desire to find new horizons and kill the people who live
beyond them.  There were the mysterious scrolls.  There was the cucumber.
But mostly there was the knowledge that one day, it would all be over.

'Ah, well, life goes on,' people say when someone dies.  But from the
point of view of the person who has just died, it doesn't.  It's the
universe that goes on.  Just as the deceased was getting the hang of
everything it's all whisked away, by illness or accident or, in one
case, a cucumber.  Why this has to be is one of the imponderables of
life, in the face of which people either start to pray...
or become really, really angry.

'And they're /heroes/,' said Mr Betteridge of the Guild of Historians.

'And that means, exactly?' said the Patrician, sighing.

'They're good at doing what they want to do.'

'But they are also, as I understand it, very old men.'

'Very old /heroes/,' the historian corrected him.  'That just means
they've had a lot of /experience/ in doing what they want to do.

Lord Vetinari sighed again.  He did not like to live in a world of
heroes.  You had civilisation, such as it was, and you had heroes.

Captain Carrot saluted.  'Force is always the last resort, sir,' he said.

'I believe for Cohen it's the first choice,' said Lord Vetinari.

'He's not too bad if you don't come up behind him suddenly,' said Rincewind.

'Ah, there is the voice of our mission specialist,' said the Patrician.
'I just hope--  What is that on your badge, Captain Carrot?'

'Mission motto, sir,' said Carrot cheerfully.  '/Morituri Nolumus Mori/.
Rincewind suggested it.'

'I imagine he did,' said Lord Vetinari, observing the wizard coldly.
'And would you care to give us a colloquial translation, Mr Rincewind?'

'Er...' Rincewind hesitated, but there really was no escape.  'Er...

He wanted to sleep. He'd never felt this tired before. 
Vimes slumped to his knees, and then fell sideways on to the sand.
When he forced open his eyes he saw pale stars above him, and had once
again the sensation that there was someone else present.
He turned his head, wincing at the stab of pain, and saw a small but 
brightly lit folding chair on the sand. A robed figure was reclining 
in it, reading a book. A scythe was stuck in the sand beside it.
A white skeletal hand turned a page.
'You'll be Death, then?' said Vimes, after a while.

AH. MISTER VIMES, ASTUTE AS EVER. GOT IT IN ONE, said Death, shutting 
the book on his finger to keep the place.

'I've seen you before.'

I HAVE WALKED WITH YOU MANY TIMES, MISTER VIMES.

'And this is /it/, is it?'

HAS IT NEVER STRUCK YOU THAT THE CONCEPT OF A WRITTEN NARRATIVE IS
SOMEWHAT STRANGE? said Death.

Vimes could tell when people were trying to avoid something they really
didn't want to say, and it was happening here.
'Is it?' he insisted. 'Is this it? This time I die?'

COULD BE.

'Could be? What sort of answer is that?' said Vimes.

A VERY ACCURATE ONE. YOU SEE, YOU ARE HAVING A NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE,
WHICH INESCAPABLY MEANS THAT I MUST UNDERGO A NEAR VIMES EXPERIENCE. 
DON'T MIND ME. CARRY ON WHATEVER YOU WERE DOING. I HAVE A BOOK.

Vimes rolled over on to his stomach, gritted his teeth and pushed 
himself on to his hands and knees again. He managed a few yards before 
slumping back down. He heard the sound of a chair being moved. 
'Shouldn't you be somewhere else?' he said.

I AM, said Death, sitting down again.
  
'But you're here!'
  
AS WELL. Death turned a page and, for a person without breath, managed
a pretty good sigh. IT APPEARS THAT THE BUTLER DID IT.

'Did what?'

IT IS A MADE-UP STORY. VERY STRANGE. ALL ONE NEEDS TO DO IS TURN TO THE
LAST PAGE AND THE ANSWER IS THERE. WHAT, THEREFORE, IS THE POINT OF 
DELIBERATEDLY NOT KNOWING?

It sounded like gibberish to Vimes, so he ignored it. Some of the aches
had gone, although his head still hammered. There was an empty feeling,
everywhere. He just wanted to sleep.
